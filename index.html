            <p>Ivan Puluj graduated with honors from Theological Faculty of the University of Vienna (1869), later also from the Department of Philosophy (1872). In 1876 Pulyui finished his doctorate on internal friction in gasses at the University of Strasbourg
                under a supervision of August Kundt. Puluj taught at the Navy academy in Fiume (Rijeka, Croatia) (1874–1876), University of Vienna (1874–1884) and the German part of the Higher Technical School in Prague (1884–1916). He served as the rector
                of the Higher Technical School in Prague (German part) in 1888–1889. Puluj also worked as a state adviser on electrical engineering for Bohemian and Moravian local governments. In addition, he completed a translation of the Bible into
                the Ukrainian language.</p>

            <p>Puluj did heavy research into cathode rays, publishing several papers about those rays between 1880 and 1882. In 1881 as a result of experiments into what he called cold light Prof. Puluj developed the Puluj lamp; it was awarded the Silver
                Medal at the International Electrotechnical Exhibition in Paris. Throughout the world, it has become known as the "lamp of Puluj" and even it was mass-produced for some time. Puluj experimented with his new device and published his results
                in a scientific paper, Luminous Electrical Matter and the Fourth State of Matter in the Notes of the Austrian Imperial Academy of Sciences (1880–1883), but expressed his ideas in an obscure manner using obsolete terminology. Puluj did
                gain some recognition when the work was translated and published as a book by the Royal Society in the UK. While Puluj's finding were essentially X-rays, he did not recognize them as such at first. This credit would later go to Wilhelm
                Conrad Röntgen. Puluj continued to do research with his X-Ray tubes. On 8 February 1896, just 6 weeks after Röntgen presented his finding of X-Rays, Puluj published his own findings in the French magazine La Nature in Paris. His presented
                photographs included the skeleton of a stillborn child. His work was republished in various European science magazines. Puluj would release further images of human body parts, including an image of a fractured human hand, and would suggest
                possible medical usages of this new technology. Puluj made many other discoveries as well. He is particularly noted for inventing a device for determining the mechanical equivalent of heat that was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle,
                Paris, 1878. Puluj also participated in an opening of several power plants in Austria-Hungary.</p>

            <p>Puluj is also known for his contribution in promoting Ukrainian culture. He actively supported opening of a Ukrainian university in Lviv and published articles to support Ukrainian language. Together with P. Kulish and I. Nechuy-Levytsky he
                translated Gospels and Psalter into Ukrainian. Being a professor Puluj organized scholarships for Ukrainian students in Austria-Hungary.</p>
